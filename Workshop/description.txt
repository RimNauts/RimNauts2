This mod adds [b]Near-Earth Objects[/b] like moons, asteroids, space debris, and artificial-satellites. Everything is [b]visible[/b] and [b]animated[/b] as an orbit on the world map. The moons are playable biomes that needs to be discovered and the artifical satellites needs to be launched into orbit.

To launch artificial satellites you need to craft modules in the fabrication bench and load it into the cargo pod.

Mineral-rich asteroids will randomly show up in the asteroid belt for a limited time. Send up a colonist to harvest the asteroids. The number of artificial satellites orbiting the planet will increase the chance of spotting these mineral-rich asteroids.

A good way to transfer the large amount of resources you will get from the asteroids is with a delivery cannon.

The only impact this mod has on performance is on the world map. This mod utilizes its own updating loop and multithreading to optimize the NEO calculations and rendering. This mod also provides settings where you can change the amount of NEO objects you want to spawn.

[b]Can this mod be safely removed from a save?[/b]

Yes, but you need to abandon any map that you have generated on a NEO (Space Station, Moon, mineral-rich asteroids, etc...) and destroy each NEO that is selectable. To destroy the NEOs you need to go into developer mode -> enable god mode -> click on each selectable NEO and click the destroy button that shows in the bottom left.

[b]What is the point of the moons?[/b]

Mostly for role-play, but it is also a lot better on performance since there are no animals or plants on these biomes (This might change in the future).

[b]Can we get reusable ships?[/b]

Use SRTS or Vehicles Framework (Magnetic field roof currently doesn't work with SRTS).
